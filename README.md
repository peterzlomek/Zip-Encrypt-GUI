# Zip-Encrypt-GUI
ZipEncryptGUI is a C# Windows Forms application that allows users to easily zip and encrypt their files through a simple and intuitive graphical user interface. Users can select one or more files using a file dialog, and the program will compress and encrypt the files using the industry-standard AES encryption algorithm. The program also provides the ability to decrypt and extract files from an encrypted zip file.

The program uses the DotNetZip library to handle the zip file compression and encryption, and it features a responsive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to secure their files. This repository is a great starting point for developers who want to learn how to build their own file encryption applications in C#, or for users who want a secure and easy-to-use tool for managing their files.
